"**S: Subjective** The patient, a 7-year-old boy, has been experiencing recurrent episodes of unresponsiveness characterized by facial grimacing and staring, lasting 3-4 minutes each, over the past month. He does not recall these episodes, which are reported to him by family members. He describes a muddy taste in his mouth before the onset of these episodes. Following the episodes, he feels lethargic and confused. The patient denies any significant past medical history, including seizures or neurological evaluations. He is currently enrolled in second grade, lives with his parents and one sibling, and reports no use of medications or exposure to toxins. Additionally, he denies any fever, headache, visual or auditory disturbances, weakness, or other systemic symptoms. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits for his age: temperature 36.8°C (98°F), blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Neurological examination reveals the patient to be alert and oriented for his age, with no acute distress. Cranial nerves are intact, motor examination shows normal tone, strength, and bulk in all four extremities, and sensory examination is intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception. Coordination and reflexes are normal, with no dysmetria on finger-nose-finger or heel-knee-shin tests and 2+ reflexes throughout without Babinski sign. Diagnostic tests including an Electroencephalogram (EEG) show interictal spikes and sharp waves localized to the temporal lobes, more prominent on the right side. MRI of the brain reveals no evidence of mass lesions, infarctions, or structural abnormalities. Complete blood count and serum electrolytes are within normal ranges. **A: Assessment** Based on the subjective history provided by the patient and his family, coupled with the objective findings from the neurological examination and diagnostic tests, the diagnosis is Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. The EEG findings are particularly indicative of this condition, despite the absence of any structural abnormalities on MRI. The patient's lack of past medical history, normal developmental status, and the specific characteristics of his episodes further support this diagnosis. **P: Plan** Given the diagnosis of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, the patient will be started on antiepileptic drug therapy tailored to his specific needs and condition. Medication options will be discussed with the family, considering the most effective profiles with the least side effects for his age and condition. Additionally, patient and family education on epilepsy management, including seizure precautions and emergency plans, will be provided. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in 4-6 weeks to assess the patient's response to the medication and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Further evaluations may be considered if the patient does not respond to initial therapy or if there are changes in his seizure pattern."
