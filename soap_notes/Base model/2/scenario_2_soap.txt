"**S: Subjective** The patient, a 24-year-old woman, presents with complaints of fever and abdominal tenderness that began three days ago. She reports an increase in vaginal discharge, which has become more yellowish, though without a significant change in odor. The patient denies experiencing chills, nausea, or vomiting but has noticed an increased frequency of urination without pain or burning sensations. She has no recent history of bladder or kidney infections and has not undergone any surgeries or medical procedures recently, except for a vaginal delivery of an 11-pound boy at 40 weeks gestation about a week ago. The patient mentions no pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in her legs, and although she has been able to keep food and liquids down, she notes a slight decrease in appetite since the onset of symptoms. She denies having any fever during the last weeks of her pregnancy and has been following standard postpartum care instructions without taking any medications except for a multivitamin and iron supplements. There is no redness, swelling, or discharge from the area of the natural tear, and she has not experienced headaches, dizziness, changes in vision, unusual odors from the vaginal discharge, breast tenderness, redness, or issues with breastfeeding. The patient has not had any postpartum follow-up visits yet. **O: Objective** Vital signs at presentation include a temperature of 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure of 118/78 mmHg, heart rate of 111/min, respiratory rate of 17/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals a non-distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds, tympanic percussion throughout, and a tender uterus. Pulmonary examination notes minor bibasilar crackles with no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's complete blood count (CBC) and urinalysis results are pending, but initial tests show normal readings. The patient's history of a prolonged labor during a vaginal delivery and her postpartum status are noted, along with her living situation with her partner and absence of smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. **A: Assessment** Based on the patient's subjective complaints and objective findings, the diagnosis of endometritis is considered. The patient's postpartum status, coupled with her symptoms of fever, uterine tenderness, and increased vaginal discharge, support this diagnosis. The normal CBC and urinalysis results, along with the absence of respiratory distress or urinary tract infection symptoms, further narrow down the differential diagnoses. The patient's recent childbirth experience, particularly after a prolonged labor, increases her risk for postpartum infections such as endometritis. **P: Plan** The management plan for the patient includes initiating antibiotic therapy to address the endometritis. Given the patient's postpartum status and the clinical presentation, a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen will be started to cover the most likely pathogens. The patient will be advised to monitor her symptoms closely and report any worsening or new symptoms immediately. A follow-up visit will be scheduled within one week to assess the response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. The patient will also be educated on the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics and on general postpartum care to prevent further complications. Further diagnostic tests may be considered if the patient does not show expected improvement or if her symptoms worsen."
