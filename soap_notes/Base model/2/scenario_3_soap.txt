"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 45-year-old female presenting with a primary complaint of rectal bleeding occurring daily with bowel movements for the past two weeks. She reports no pain with defecation and denies any changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms. The patient's past medical history is unremarkable except for 5 normal vaginal deliveries. There is no reported use of medications or supplements that could potentially cause bleeding, such as NSAIDs or blood thinners. The patient also denies any family history of gastrointestinal diseases, recent changes in diet or stress levels, recent infections, exposure to known irritants or allergens, and any recent trauma to the rectal area. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), blood pressure at 115/85 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths/min. A rectovaginal examination revealed a palpable, non-tender, prolapsed mass that can be easily pushed back into the anal sphincter by the examiner's finger. Complete Blood Count shows white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets within normal limits. An anoscopy visualized internal hemorrhoids. Both colonoscopy and rectal ultrasound results returned normal readings. **A: Assessment** Given the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and normal diagnostic test results, the differential diagnosis includes an internal hemorrhoid that was not detected during the initial examinations or a rectal polyp that was missed. The absence of common gastrointestinal symptoms, normal colonoscopy, and rectal ultrasound results, combined with no significant medical, family, or lifestyle risk factors, make the diagnosis challenging. However, the presence of a palpable rectal mass and rectal bleeding suggests a possible internal hemorrhoid or rectal polyp. **P: Plan** The patient will be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation to obtain a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. This may include a repeat anoscopy or a more detailed examination under anesthesia to identify any internal hemorrhoids or rectal polyps that were not detected during the initial examinations. The patient will be advised to monitor her symptoms and report any changes or worsening of her condition. Follow-up after the specialist consultation will be necessary to review the findings and discuss the recommended treatment options."
