"**S: Subjective** The patient, a 48-year-old woman and elementary school teacher, presents with a primary complaint of a mass in her left breast, first noticed 4 weeks ago. She reports a rapid increase in the size of the mass since its discovery. The patient denies any associated pain, skin changes, nipple changes, or discomfort in the area. She has no recent history of trauma, infections, significant past medical or surgical history, and no family history of breast cancer. Additionally, the patient denies any recent fever, weight loss, night sweats, or changes in appetite. She is a non-smoker with moderate alcohol use. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), Blood Pressure 125/80 mmHg, Heart Rate 72 bpm, Respiratory Rate 14 breaths/min. Breast examination reveals a 6-cm, nontender, multinodular mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast without any palpable axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy. Inspection shows no skin changes, nipple retraction, or discharge. Mammography findings indicate a smooth polylobulated mass in the left breast. Biopsy microscopic description shows leaf-like structures with stromal cellular overgrowth, suggesting a benign nature of the cells. **A: Assessment** The clinical presentation and diagnostic findings are indicative of a Phyllodes Tumor of the Breast. The rapid growth and size of the mass, despite its benign nature, necessitate careful consideration of management options to prevent potential complications and ensure the patient's overall health and quality of life. **P: Plan** Given the diagnosis of a benign Phyllodes Tumor, the patient and I have discussed potential treatment options, including the possibility of surgical removal due to its rapid growth and size. The decision will be made in consideration of the patient's overall health and quality of life. Further detailed information on the cellular nature of the tumor is awaited to finalize the treatment plan. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and finalize the treatment approach. Patient education on the nature of Phyllodes Tumors, potential risks, and the importance of regular breast examinations will be provided."
