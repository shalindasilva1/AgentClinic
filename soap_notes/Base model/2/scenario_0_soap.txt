"**S: Subjective** The patient, a female newborn, presented with a continuous heart murmur and bluish macules on the skin that do not blanch with pressure, as reported by the mother. The mother denies any difficulties with feeding or a decrease in the newborn's activity level. There have been no observed issues with breathing, unusual crying or irritability, cold extremities, episodes of fainting, or changes in skin color during crying or feeding. The newborn has been gaining weight appropriately and growing as expected. There is no known family history of heart problems or genetic disorders. The mother has not noticed any swelling in the legs, abdomen, or around the eyes, nor any issues with excessive sweating. Since the last discussion, there have been no changes in the newborn's breathing or feeding patterns, nor any episodes of infections or respiratory issues more than what might be expected for her age. The newborn's weight gain has been steady without difficulty. **O: Objective** The newborn, delivered at term to a 23-year-old primigravida mother with no prenatal care, weighs 3000 g (6.6 lb). Vital signs are within normal limits for a newborn: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), heart rate 140 bpm, and respiratory rate 40 breaths/min. Cardiac examination reveals a continuous 'machinery' murmur. Skin examination shows several bluish macules that do not blanch upon application of pressure. Ophthalmic examination indicates cloudy lenses in both eyes, and audiological examination reveals failed auditory screening tests. Diagnostic tests include a positive Rubella IgM with other TORCH screen components negative, echocardiogram findings indicative of Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), ophthalmologic consult findings of congenital cataracts, and hearing tests showing bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. **A: Assessment** The newborn has been diagnosed with Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), evidenced by echocardiogram findings. The presence of a continuous heart murmur, bluish macules on the skin, cloudy lenses, and failed auditory screening tests, along with a positive Rubella IgM, suggests a congenital condition possibly related to a TORCH infection, specifically rubella. The combination of congenital cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and PDA aligns with a classic presentation of congenital rubella syndrome, although this diagnosis requires further investigation and correlation with clinical findings. **P: Plan** Given the diagnosis of PDA and the stable condition of the newborn, a referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for further evaluation and discussion of treatment options, which may include observation, medication, catheter-based procedures, or surgery depending on the size of the PDA and the symptoms it's causing. It is crucial to monitor for signs of heart failure and to seek immediate medical attention if there is increased difficulty with feeding, significant changes in activity level, episodes of rapid breathing, or cyanosis around the lips and fingertips. The mother should gather all medical records, test results, and a detailed history of any symptoms or changes for the consultation with the pediatric cardiologist. Additionally, the findings of congenital cataracts and sensorineural hearing loss warrant further evaluation by specialists in ophthalmology and audiology, respectively, to address these conditions and discuss potential interventions. Follow-up on the positive Rubella IgM and the implications for the newborn's health and development is also necessary."
