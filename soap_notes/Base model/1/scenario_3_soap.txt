"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 55-year-old male presenting with a 4-week history of fatigue, worsening abdominal pain, excessive night sweats, and significant weight loss of approximately 5.4 kg (12 lb) without trying. He also reports noticing swelling in his neck developing over the last 4 days. The patient has a history of smoking, consuming one pack per day for the past 30 years, and drinks alcohol socially. He works in construction and denies any significant past medical history, including major illnesses or surgeries. The patient also mentions feeling an unusual fullness in the belly area, making it difficult to wear his usual clothing. He denies experiencing fever, cough, or having any recent travel history. **O: Objective** Vital signs are recorded with a temperature of 36.8°C (98°F), blood pressure at 135/80 mmHg, heart rate at 82 bpm, and respiratory rate at 14 breaths/min. Physical examination reveals a nontender, enlarged, and fixed supraclavicular lymph node upon neck inspection and palpation. Abdominal examination shows slight distension, normal bowel sounds, dullness over the left lower quadrant on percussion, and detection of splenomegaly without rebound tenderness on palpation. Laboratory tests indicate elevated white blood cells, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Lactate dehydrogenase levels are elevated. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen reveals massively enlarged axillary, mediastinal, and cervical lymph nodes. A biopsy of the cervical lymph node shows lymphocytes with a high proliferative index that stain positive for CD20. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. The symptoms of fatigue, abdominal pain, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss, combined with the physical findings of enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly, support this diagnosis. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase and specific biopsy findings further corroborate the diagnosis of lymphoma. **P: Plan** 1. **Medical Management:** The patient will be referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management of lymphoma. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both, depending on the specific type and stage of lymphoma. 2. **Supportive Care:** Nutritional support and counseling will be provided to address the patient's weight loss and to ensure adequate caloric intake during treatment. 3. **Smoking Cessation:** The patient will be counseled on the importance of quitting smoking and will be provided with resources to assist in smoking cessation. 4. **Follow-Up:** The patient will have a follow-up appointment scheduled with the oncologist for further assessment and to initiate treatment. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to manage any side effects. 5. **Patient Education:** The patient will be educated about lymphoma, treatment options, potential side effects, and the importance of follow-up appointments. He will also be informed about the significance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle during treatment. This plan aims to address the patient's immediate health concerns, provide a clear path forward for treatment, and support the patient's overall well-being during this challenging time."
