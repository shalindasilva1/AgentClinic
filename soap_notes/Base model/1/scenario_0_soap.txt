"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 35-year-old female who presents with a 1-month history of double vision (diplopia), difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness when attempting to brush her hair. She reports that these symptoms tend to worsen after physical activity but show significant improvement after a few hours of rest. The patient denies experiencing muscle pain, cramps, difficulty swallowing, changes in voice, issues with breathing, shortness of breath, changes in vision other than double vision, recent infections or illnesses, exposure to toxins or chemicals, changes in weight or appetite, numbness or tingling in limbs, and any family history of similar symptoms or neurological conditions. She also reports no difficulty with coordination or balance, and no use of medications or supplements that could affect her symptoms. The patient notes an improvement in symptoms, particularly double vision and eyelid heaviness, after resting, especially after a good night's sleep. She denies any issues with her sense of smell or taste and any changes in sensory perception. She is a non-smoker, drinks wine occasionally, and works as a graphic designer. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), Blood Pressure 125/80 mmHg, Heart Rate 72 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 16 breaths/min. Neurological examination reveals the presence of ptosis (drooping of the right upper eyelid) that worsens with sustained upward gaze, diminished motor strength in the upper extremities with normal tone and no obvious atrophy, normal reflexes throughout, and normal sensation throughout. Blood tests show elevated Acetylcholine Receptor Antibodies. Electromyography findings indicate decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation. Chest CT is normal, with no thymoma or other masses detected. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation, along with the objective findings from the neurological examination, blood tests showing elevated Acetylcholine Receptor Antibodies, and electromyography results, support a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. The symptoms of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and upper limb weakness, which improve with rest, are characteristic of this condition. The absence of a family history of autoimmune diseases and the specific improvement of symptoms with rest further corroborate this diagnosis. **P: Plan** 1. Initiate treatment with Pyridostigmine to improve muscle strength and alleviate symptoms. 2. Recommend the patient to avoid strenuous physical activities and to take frequent rest breaks throughout the day to manage symptoms effectively. 3. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess the response to medication and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. 4. Advise the patient on the importance of monitoring for symptoms of a myasthenic crisis, such as severe muscle weakness or respiratory difficulties, and to seek immediate medical attention if these occur. 5. Consider referral to a neurologist for specialized care and management of Myasthenia Gravis. 6. Educate the patient about Myasthenia Gravis, including potential triggers, symptom management strategies, and the importance of adherence to treatment and follow-up appointments."
