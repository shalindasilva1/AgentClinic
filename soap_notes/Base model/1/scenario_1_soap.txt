"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** A 35-year-old woman presents for a follow-up regarding her Crohn's disease, reporting new-onset difficulty walking, described by her peers as \"appearing drunk.\" She has been experiencing symptoms of gait and limb ataxia for a few months, with a progressive worsening over the last few weeks. The patient reports numbness and tingling, particularly in her right hand and arm, making it difficult to grasp objects. She denies any changes in speech, swallowing abilities, vision, recent infections, fevers, illnesses, previous injuries to her head, neck, or spine, and any family history of neurological diseases. There have been no significant changes in mood, cognitive functions, exposure to toxins or chemicals, or changes in bladder or bowel control. The patient has noticed weakness in her right arm and difficulty with balance and coordination. She has been taking natalizumab for her Crohn's disease for the past year and has been monitored with regular blood tests as part of her treatment plan. No MRI scans of her brain or spinal cord have been performed since the onset of these symptoms. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal ranges, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. Neurological examination reveals an ataxic gait and evidence of ataxia in coordination tests. Strength in the right upper limb is rated 4/5. MRI of the brain shows lesions consistent with Progressive Multifocal Encephalopathy (PML), with T1/T2 images showing multifocal demyelinating lesions without gadolinium enhancement. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation and MRI findings are indicative of Progressive Multifocal Encephalopathy (PML), a rare and often severe viral infection of the brain. The rapid progression of symptoms, including worsening gait and limb ataxia, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the right arm, align with this diagnosis. The use of natalizumab, a medication known to increase the risk of PML in individuals with weakened immune systems, is a significant contributing factor to the patient's condition. **P: Plan** 1. Immediate referral to a neurologist for comprehensive management of PML. 2. Discontinue natalizumab treatment to prevent further immunosuppression. 3. Initiate discussions with the patient about the diagnosis, prognosis, and potential treatment options for PML, including antiviral therapies and supportive care. 4. Schedule regular follow-up appointments for close monitoring of neurological status and response to treatment. 5. Educate the patient on recognizing signs of disease progression or complications to seek prompt medical attention. 6. Coordinate care with the patient's gastroenterologist to adjust her Crohn's disease management plan in light of the PML diagnosis."
