"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** An 8-month-old boy presents with a week-long history of feeding difficulties and abdominal distension. The patient's mother reports that he has been very fussy, especially during and after feedings, and cries more than usual, suggesting abdominal pain. Despite decreased feeding, the child appears to have gained weight. There have been fewer bowel movements, which are now lighter in color and firmer. The child has been drinking less and has less wet diapers. He has been less active and more tired. There is no history of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing difficulties, previous medical issues, surgeries, exposure to new foods, or changes in diet. The family history is non-contributory, and there were no complications during birth at 39 weeks of gestation. This is the first child to young parents with no history of similar illness in the family. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits for age, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure normal for age, heart rate at 120 bpm, and respiratory rate at 30 breaths/min. Abdominal examination reveals distension, with normal bowel sounds, tympanitic sound noted in the left lower quadrant, and the abdomen is soft but distended. Crying intensifies on palpation, especially in the left lower quadrant. The abdominal ultrasound showed normal readings. A comprehensive metabolic panel returned normal results. An abdominal X-ray indicated dilated bowel segments with the absence of gas in the rectum, suggesting a possible obstruction. Blood tests including WBC, hemoglobin, and platelets are normal. A barium enema revealed a transition zone in the distal colon, compatible with Hirschsprung disease. **A: Assessment** The clinical presentation and examination findings, including the specific symptoms of feeding difficulties, abdominal distension, altered bowel movements, and the specific findings from the abdominal X-ray and barium enema, suggest a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. This condition is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to a functional obstruction. **P: Plan** 1. Refer to pediatric surgery for evaluation and management of Hirschsprung disease. 2. Initiate bowel management to prevent fecal impaction and worsening of symptoms until surgical consultation can occur. 3. Educate the parents about the condition, its implications, and the importance of follow-up care. 4. Schedule a follow-up appointment post-surgical consultation to monitor the child's progress and recovery. 5. Provide support resources for the family to help manage the child's condition and care needs."
