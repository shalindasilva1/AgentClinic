"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** A 62-year-old woman presents with complaints of fatigue, flank pain, and a persistent fever for approximately three weeks, which began shortly after initiating antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis. Initially treated with amoxicillin, she developed a rash, leading to a switch to cephalexin, after which the rash resolved. She denies any changes in urine color or smell, nausea, vomiting, significant changes in appetite, dysuria, or recent exposure to sick individuals or travel. She also reports episodes of chills, particularly in the evenings, and excessive night sweating. The patient has a medical history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux, for which she is on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. She is a retired school teacher, a non-smoker, and drinks alcohol socially. **O: Objective** Vital signs reveal a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure of 145/90 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. General examination shows no current rash or lesions, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, mild flank tenderness without rebound or guarding, and mild tenderness on percussion of the renal angles. Serum biochemistry tests indicate elevated urea and creatinine levels. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, a negative bacterial culture, and 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm when stained with Hansel’s solution. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. This assessment is based on her symptoms of fatigue, flank pain, and fever, which persisted despite the resolution of sinusitis symptoms, in conjunction with elevated urea and creatinine levels, and the presence of leukocyturia. The history of a rash during antibiotic treatment and the absence of dysuria, changes in urine color or smell, and other systemic symptoms further support this diagnosis. **P: Plan** 1. Initiate treatment with appropriate antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis, considering the patient's recent antibiotic history and current renal function. 2. Advise the patient to increase fluid intake to help flush the urinary tract. 3. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. 4. Recommend over-the-counter analgesics for pain management, as needed. 5. Monitor renal function and adjust medications accordingly to avoid potential nephrotoxicity. 6. Educate the patient on the signs of worsening infection or renal function and instruct her to seek immediate medical attention if these occur."
