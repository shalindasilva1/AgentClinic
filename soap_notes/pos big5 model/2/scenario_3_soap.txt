"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 32-year-old male presenting with a 2-month history of increasing generalized fatigue and severe pruritus. He reports scleral icterus and has noticed multiple scratch marks on his trunk and extremities due to itching. The patient has a medical history of hypertension, diagnosed 5 years ago, and ulcerative colitis. He is currently taking Lisinopril for hypertension and Rectal Mesalamine for ulcerative colitis. The patient is sexually active with 2 female partners and reports inconsistent condom use. He denies any fever, diarrhea, joint pain, or recent travel. The patient has not experienced any significant weight loss, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, or discomfort. He has observed that his urine has been darker than usual and his bowel movements lighter in color. There is no family history of liver disease or similar symptoms. The patient has not been vaccinated against hepatitis and is unsure about exposure to viral infections. **O: Objective** Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F), Blood Pressure 130/84 mmHg, Heart Rate 86 bpm, and Respiratory Rate within normal limits. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, scleral icterus, and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities. The abdominal examination shows no distension, normal bowel sounds, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly noted. Blood work indicates Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL, Leukocyte Count: 7500/mm^3, Platelet Count: 280,000/mm^3, Sodium: 138 mEq/L, Potassium: 4.7 mEq/L, Total Bilirubin: 1.5 mg/dL, Direct Bilirubin: 0.9 mg/dL, Alkaline Phosphatase: 460 U/L (elevated), AST: 75 U/L (elevated), ALT: 78 U/L (elevated), with Anti-Nuclear Antibody and Antimitochondrial Antibodies being negative. Abdominal Ultrasound findings include thickening of the bile ducts and focal bile duct dilatation. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed normal readings. **A: Assessment** The patient presents with generalized fatigue, severe pruritus, scleral icterus, and elevated liver enzymes, suggestive of liver dysfunction. The absence of abdominal pain, fever, significant weight loss, and the specific pattern of liver enzyme elevation, along with ultrasound findings, point towards a hepatobiliary cause. Given the negative antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies, autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis are less likely. The normal MRCP findings rule out mechanical obstruction. Considering the patient's history of ulcerative colitis, the differential diagnosis includes primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which is supported by the cholangiopathy seen on ultrasound and the absence of a clear cause for his symptoms. **P: Plan** 1. Confirm the diagnosis of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis with further serological testing and possibly a liver biopsy. 2. Initiate symptom management for pruritus and fatigue. Consider prescribing cholestyramine for pruritus and recommend adequate hydration and rest. 3. Counsel the patient on the importance of regular follow-up for liver function tests and monitoring of his condition. 4. Discuss the potential need for future interventions, including endoscopic or radiologic procedures to manage bile duct strictures if confirmed to have PSC. 5. Refer the patient to a gastroenterologist for specialized care and management of his ulcerative colitis and potential PSC. 6. Educate the patient on the importance of safe sexual practices and consider screening for viral hepatitis given his sexual history. 7. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to review test results and adjust the management plan as necessary."
