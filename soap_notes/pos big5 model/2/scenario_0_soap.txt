"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 63-year-old male who presents with a primary complaint of a skin lesion on his chest, first noticed approximately two months ago. He reports that the lesion has increased in size but denies any changes in color or shape. There has been no associated pain, itching, or bleeding from the lesion. The patient denies significant recent sun exposure or use of tanning beds, any family history of skin cancer, and any recent unusual symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, or night sweats. He has not noticed similar lesions elsewhere on his body and has not applied any treatments to the lesion. Additionally, the patient denies any recent illnesses, infections, significant stressors, known allergies, changes in the texture or sensation of the lesion. His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and glaucoma. He has a social history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and drinking two to three beers on weekends. He denies recent weight loss, fever, fatigue, or changes in appetite. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 36.8°C (98°F), Blood Pressure 130/85 mmHg, Heart Rate 75 bpm, Respiratory Rate 14 breaths/min. Skin examination reveals a single, partly elevated lesion located on the chest, exhibiting asymmetry, border irregularity, and varied color with a diameter larger than 6mm. The lesion is firm on palpation, partly elevated, and does not change form on pinching. Histopathology findings from a skin biopsy confirm the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, showing atypical melanocytes that infiltrate both the epidermis and dermis. **A: Assessment** The patient has been diagnosed with malignant melanoma based on the clinical presentation and histopathology findings from the skin biopsy. The lesion's characteristics, such as asymmetry, border irregularity, varied color, and diameter larger than 6mm, alongside the biopsy results, support this diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking and advanced age may contribute to his risk factors for skin cancer, although he denies significant sun exposure, which is a common risk factor for melanoma. **P: Plan** 1. **Treatment**: The patient will be referred to a dermatologic oncologist for further evaluation and management of malignant melanoma. Surgical excision of the lesion with appropriate margins will likely be recommended. 2. **Medications**: Post-surgical treatment may include targeted therapy or immunotherapy, depending on the stage and characteristics of the melanoma. Specific medications will be determined by the oncologist. 3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: The patient will be advised to avoid sun exposure and to use sunscreen with high SPF to protect the skin. Smoking cessation will also be strongly recommended due to its general health risks and potential impact on cancer prognosis. 4. **Follow-up**: A follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-surgery to assess healing and discuss further treatment plans. Regular skin examinations will be necessary to monitor for new lesions or recurrence. 5. **Education**: The patient will be educated about the importance of skin protection, signs of potential skin cancer recurrence, and the impact of lifestyle factors on cancer prognosis. The patient will be provided with support and resources for smoking cessation and will be encouraged to maintain regular follow-up appointments for ongoing monitoring and management."
