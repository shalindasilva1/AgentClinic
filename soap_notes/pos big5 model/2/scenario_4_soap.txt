"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** A 40-year-old female presents with a 5-month history of worsening bladder discomfort, which is relieved by voiding. She reports an increased frequency of urination, voiding 10-15 times during the day and waking up 2-3 times at night to void. The patient denies any involuntary loss of urine. Attempts to manage the discomfort with reduced fluid intake and NSAIDs have provided minimal relief. Additionally, she reports recent painful intercourse. The patient has a significant medical history of bipolar disorder, currently managed with lithium. She is married, sexually active with her husband, and denies significant alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drug use. She denies fever, hematuria, back pain, pelvic pain other than with intercourse, and any recent infections. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 37°C (98.6°F), Blood Pressure 110/80 mm Hg, Heart Rate 65 bpm, Respiratory Rate 16 breaths/min. Abdominal examination shows normal inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation except for tenderness in the suprapubic region without masses palpated. Pelvic examination reveals no external lesions, vaginal discharge, or obvious masses. The cervix appears normal upon speculum examination, and bimanual examination reveals a normal uterus and adnexa with discomfort noted on palpation of the bladder region. Urinalysis results show clear color, pH 6.7, specific gravity 1.010, protein 1+, glucose negative, ketones negative, blood negative, nitrite negative, leukocyte esterase negative, WBC 0/hpf, squamous epithelial cells 2/hpf, and no bacteria. Pelvic ultrasound shows a postvoid residual urine volume of 25 mL. Cystoscopy findings indicate a normal urethra and bladder mucosa. Comprehensive metabolic panel and specific kidney function tests such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels returned with normal readings. **A: Assessment** The patient's symptoms, along with the exclusion of other potential causes through testing, suggest a diagnosis of suspected Interstitial Cystitis/Overactive Bladder Syndrome. The presence of bladder discomfort relieved by voiding, increased frequency of urination, nocturia, and painful intercourse, in the absence of significant findings from urinalysis, pelvic ultrasound, and cystoscopy, supports this assessment. The normal comprehensive metabolic panel and specific kidney function tests further rule out significant underlying kidney issues. **P: Plan** 1. Referral to a urologist for a more specialized evaluation of suspected Interstitial Cystitis/Overactive Bladder Syndrome. The urologist may conduct further tests or trials of treatment to help manage the patient's symptoms. 2. Continue monitoring lithium levels due to the patient's bipolar disorder treatment, considering the medication's potential impact on kidney function. 3. Advise the patient to maintain a symptom diary, noting any triggers or patterns in symptoms, which may be useful for the urologist's evaluation. 4. Schedule a follow-up appointment after the urologist's evaluation to discuss findings and coordinate care. 5. Encourage the patient to continue avoiding known bladder irritants in the diet and to practice stress reduction techniques, which may help alleviate some symptoms. The patient has been informed of the next steps and expressed understanding and agreement with the proposed plan. She is hopeful for a resolution to her symptoms and appreciates the referral to a specialist."
