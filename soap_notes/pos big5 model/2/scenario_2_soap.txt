"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** A 40-year-old nulliparous woman presents with a one-month history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and noticeable increase in abdominal girth. She reports no significant weight changes, abdominal or pelvic pain, changes in appetite, bowel habits, or urinary frequency. The patient has experienced increased fatigue and feels full quickly when eating. She denies any fever, night sweats, unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge, and changes in her menstrual cycle. There is no family history of ovarian cancer or significant medical history. She is a non-smoker, does not consume alcohol regularly, and works as a high school teacher. The patient has not noticed any swelling in her legs, changes in her skin, or difficulty breathing beyond the shortness of breath. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits with a temperature of 36.8°C (98°F), blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min. Respiratory examination reveals mild use of accessory muscles to breathe, dullness on percussion in the right lower lung fields, and decreased breath sounds in the right basal areas. Abdominal examination shows visible distension, normal bowel sounds, shifting dullness suggestive of ascites, and a non-tender fluid wave positive. A palpable mass is noted on the right side of the pelvis during the pelvic examination. Complete blood count reveals WBC of 8,500 /μL, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, and platelets of 275,000 /μL. Chest X-Ray indicates a right-sided pleural effusion. Abdominal ultrasound findings include a large mass in the right ovary with significant ascites present. CA-125 levels are normal. **A: Assessment** The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a benign ovarian tumor or cyst as the cause of the ascites and symptoms due to its size and pressure effects. The presence of a large ovarian mass, significant ascites, normal CA-125 levels, and exclusion of other common causes through testing and history support this assessment. The differential diagnosis includes benign ovarian neoplasms, with the possibility of a malignant process being less likely given the normal CA-125 level. Further evaluation is necessary to definitively diagnose the condition. **P: Plan** 1. Further diagnostic evaluation with a biopsy of the ovarian mass to determine its nature definitively. 2. Management of symptoms, including addressing the shortness of breath and abdominal discomfort. Consider diuretics for management of ascites after further evaluation. 3. Referral to a gynecologist/oncologist for specialized care and potential surgical intervention based on biopsy results. 4. Address patient's stress and emotional well-being through supportive counseling and possibly referral to a mental health professional. 5. Schedule a follow-up appointment to review biopsy results and adjust the management plan accordingly. 6. Continue monitoring vital signs and symptoms, advising the patient to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately."
