"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 31-year-old female presenting with chronic diarrhea and lower abdominal discomfort for the past four months. She reports that the symptoms are constant and not triggered by specific foods. The patient denies significant weight loss, fever, or blood in her stool but reports increased fatigue. She has noticed mucus in her stool, which remains a normal brown color. The patient mentions being under work-related stress but no significant life changes coinciding with symptom onset. Previous attempts to manage symptoms with over-the-counter anti-diarrheals and increased fiber intake have been unsuccessful. She denies joint pain, eye irritation, or skin rashes. There is no family history of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. The patient recalls a camping trip a few months ago, after which another group member also fell ill, suggesting possible exposure to contaminated food or water. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 37°C (98.6°F), Blood Pressure 122/78 mmHg, Heart Rate 67 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 15 breaths/min. Abdominal examination reveals mild diffuse abdominal discomfort with no visible abnormalities, normal bowel sounds, non-tender on percussion, and no rebound tenderness or guarding on palpation. The Complete Blood Count (CBC) shows a slightly elevated Total WBC Count of 11,000/mm3 with Neutrophils at 70%, Lymphocytes at 25%, and Monocytes at 5%. Hemoglobin is 13 gm/dL, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is 10 mm/hr, both within normal limits. Routine Stool Examination and Stool Culture results are within normal limits. Celiac Disease Panel, including tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA) and endomysial antibodies (EMA), shows normal readings. **A: Assessment** The patient's chronic diarrhea, lower abdominal discomfort, and the absence of specific food triggers, significant weight loss, fever, or blood in stool, combined with the test results, suggest a diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible low-grade infection or inflammation, but normal stool culture results rule out common bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections. The lack of family history and normal celiac disease panel results further support the IBS diagnosis over other gastrointestinal diseases. **P: Plan** 1. Initiate a trial of probiotics for a few weeks to assess improvement in symptoms, given the potential benefits of balancing gut flora. 2. Recommend a food diary to identify any potential dietary triggers or patterns associated with symptom exacerbation. 3. Suggest dietary modifications, including a low FODMAP diet, to alleviate symptoms. 4. Advise the patient to maintain hydration and consider over-the-counter antispasmodics for relief of abdominal discomfort as needed. 5. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to evaluate the response to probiotics and dietary changes, and to discuss further management based on symptom improvement or persistence. 6. Provide patient education on IBS, emphasizing the importance of stress management and regular exercise as part of comprehensive symptom management."
