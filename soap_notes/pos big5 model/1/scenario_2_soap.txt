"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** An 8-month-old boy presented with his mother due to concerns about feeding difficulties and fussiness during feeding attempts over the past few days. The mother reports that despite these feeding challenges, the child appears to have gained weight. There has been increased crying, particularly when the abdomen is palpated. No changes in bowel movements, vomiting, or signs of infection such as fever have been reported. The child has been less active than usual. There is no significant past medical or surgical history, and the child was delivered vaginally at 39 weeks without complications. This is the first child for the young parents, and there is no family history of similar illness. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits for age, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure normal for age, heart rate at 120 bpm, and respiratory rate at 30 breaths/min. Abdominal examination revealed distension with normal bowel sounds upon auscultation. Percussion produced a tympanitic sound in the left lower quadrant, and palpation showed the abdomen to be soft but distended, with the child crying intensively, especially when the left lower quadrant was palpated. Blood tests including WBC, hemoglobin, and platelets were within normal ranges. An abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel segments with absence of gas in the rectum, suggesting a possible obstruction. A barium enema revealed a transition zone in the distal colon, compatible with Hirschsprung disease. **A: Assessment** The clinical presentation and examination findings, including the characteristic radiographic evidence from the abdominal X-ray and barium enema, support a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. This condition is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to a functional obstruction and symptoms such as feeding difficulties, abdominal distension, and altered bowel movements. The weight gain despite decreased feeding could be attributed to intermittent bowel obstruction and subsequent malabsorption or ineffective feeding patterns. **P: Plan** 1. **Referral to Pediatric Surgery:** Immediate referral to a pediatric surgeon for further evaluation and management, including the possibility of surgical intervention to remove the affected segment of the colon. 2. **Supportive Care:** Until surgical consultation, focus on supportive care including hydration and nutrition management. Consider nasogastric tube feeding if oral feeding difficulties persist or worsen. 3. **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of bowel movements, abdominal distension, and overall well-being. Parents should be advised to monitor for signs of bowel obstruction or enterocolitis, such as increased fussiness, vomiting, fever, or a swollen abdomen, and to seek immediate medical attention if these occur. 4. **Education:** Educate the parents about Hirschsprung disease, including its implications and the importance of follow-up care and monitoring for complications. 5. **Follow-Up:** Arrange for a follow-up appointment post-referral to assess the child's progress and to adjust the care plan as necessary based on the surgical team's recommendations and interventions. This plan aims to address the immediate needs of the child while preparing for definitive treatment of the underlying condition."
