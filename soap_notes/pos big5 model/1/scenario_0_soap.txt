"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 35-year-old female who has been experiencing double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness in the upper limbs for about a month. These symptoms tend to worsen after physical activity and improve significantly after a few hours of rest. She reports no muscle pain or cramps, changes in voice or difficulty swallowing, respiratory issues, numbness, tingling, recent infections, exposure to toxins, changes in taste or smell, bowel or bladder control issues, or significant weight or appetite changes. The patient has noticed difficulty with tasks requiring sustained muscle use, such as holding a book up to read. There is no family history of similar symptoms or neurological conditions. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks wine occasionally, and works as a graphic designer. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 36.6°C (97.9°F), Blood Pressure 125/80 mmHg, Heart Rate 72 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 16 breaths/min. Neurological examination revealed the presence of ptosis (drooping of the right upper eyelid) that worsens with sustained upward gaze, diminished motor strength in the upper extremities with normal tone and no obvious atrophy, normal reflexes, and normal sensation throughout. Diagnostic tests showed elevated Acetylcholine Receptor Antibodies. Electromyography indicated decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation. Chest CT was normal with no thymoma or other masses detected. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation, along with the objective findings and diagnostic test results, support a diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. The pattern of symptoms worsening with activity and improving with rest, coupled with the presence of ptosis and elevated Acetylcholine Receptor Antibodies, are characteristic of this condition. The absence of thymoma or other masses on the chest CT is noted, though Myasthenia Gravis can occur without thymoma. **P: Plan** 1. Medication: Initiate treatment with Pyridostigmine to improve neuromuscular transmission and alleviate symptoms. Monitor for efficacy and side effects. 2. Immunosuppressive therapy: Consider starting steroids or other immunosuppressants to reduce antibody production if symptoms are not adequately controlled with Pyridostigmine alone. 3. Thymectomy: Discuss the potential benefits and risks of thymectomy, especially if a thymoma is detected in the future or if the patient does not respond to medical management. 4. Lifestyle modifications: Advise the patient to avoid triggers that worsen symptoms, such as excessive physical activity, and to implement rest periods throughout the day. 5. Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. Immediate follow-up if symptoms significantly worsen or if respiratory difficulties develop. 6. Patient education: Provide information about Myasthenia Gravis, including its nature, treatment options, and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan. Encourage the patient to report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. The management plan aims to control symptoms, improve quality of life, and monitor for complications associated with Myasthenia Gravis."
