"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** A 35-year-old woman presents for a follow-up regarding her Crohn's disease, reporting new-onset difficulty walking, described by her peers as \"appearing drunk.\" She first noticed issues with walking and coordination about three months ago, which have gradually worsened. The patient denies changes in speech, swallowing, vision, cognitive functions, mood, or behavior. She has not experienced numbness, tingling, loss of sensation, dizziness, vertigo, bladder or bowel control issues, significant weight loss, or changes in appetite. The patient has been on natalizumab for her Crohn's disease for the past year. She denies any previous injuries, infections, family history of similar symptoms, or exposure to toxins that could explain her symptoms. **O: Objective** The patient is normothermic, with blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate all within normal ranges. Neurological examination reveals an ataxic gait and reduced strength in the right upper limb (4/5), with evidence of limb and gait ataxia. MRI Brain findings indicate lesions consistent with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), showing multifocal demyelinating lesions without gadolinium enhancement. **A: Assessment** The patient's symptoms of difficulty walking, gait ataxia, limb ataxia, and reduced strength in the right upper limb, combined with her history of natalizumab use for Crohn's disease, and MRI findings, support a diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). The absence of other neurological symptoms such as changes in cognitive functions, vision, or sensation, and the lack of exposure to other potential etiologies, further corroborate this diagnosis. **P: Plan** 1. Immediate discontinuation of natalizumab to prevent further progression of PML. 2. Referral to a neurologist for comprehensive management of PML, including consideration of treatment options such as plasmapheresis or antiviral therapy, depending on the neurologist's assessment. 3. Coordination with the patient's gastroenterologist to adjust her Crohn's disease management plan, considering the discontinuation of natalizumab. 4. Regular follow-up appointments with both the neurologist and gastroenterologist to monitor the patient's neurological status and Crohn's disease activity. 5. Patient education on the signs and symptoms of PML progression and the importance of immediate reporting of any new or worsening symptoms. The patient's care will require a multidisciplinary approach, involving close collaboration between her primary care physician, neurologist, and gastroenterologist, to ensure comprehensive management of both her PML and Crohn's disease."
