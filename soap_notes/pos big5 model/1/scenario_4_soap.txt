"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** A 62-year-old woman presents with complaints of fatigue, flank pain, and a persistent fever for approximately three weeks, which began a few days after initiating amoxicillin for acute sinusitis. The patient reports that her symptoms have continued despite the resolution of her sinusitis symptoms. She experienced a rash during amoxicillin treatment, which resolved after switching to cephalexin. She denies any changes in urine color, frequency, or pain during urination, as well as nausea, vomiting, dysuria, joint pain, swelling, recent weight loss, or night sweats. She has not taken any over-the-counter medications or supplements for these symptoms. Her medical history includes essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux, for which she has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole for several years. She denies any recent exposure to sick individuals, travel to areas known for infectious diseases, recent back injuries, trauma, or exposure to new substances like detergents, soaps, or environmental allergens. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially, and is a retired school teacher. **O: Objective** Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), Blood Pressure 145/90 mmHg, Heart Rate 75 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 16 breaths/min. General examination reveals no current rash or lesions, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, mild flank tenderness without rebound or guarding, and mild tenderness on percussion of the renal angles. Laboratory tests show elevated urea and creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. Urinalysis reveals the presence of leukocyturia, but the bacterial culture is negative. Cytospin stained with Hansel’s solution shows 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, suggesting an allergic or non-infectious process. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of interstitial nephritis, likely drug-induced, given the temporal association with antibiotic therapy and the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. The presence of leukocyturia and elevated renal function tests, along with the patient's symptoms and history of recent antibiotic use, support this diagnosis. The negative bacterial culture and the presence of binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm further suggest an allergic or non-infectious etiology rather than a bacterial infection. **P: Plan** 1. Discontinue the current antibiotic regimen to prevent further potential nephrotoxicity. 2. Initiate treatment with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and manage the allergic reaction. 3. Increase hydration to support kidney function and facilitate the elimination of any potential allergens or toxins. 4. Monitor kidney function closely with follow-up serum biochemistry tests to assess the response to treatment and recovery of kidney function. 5. Avoid the use of NSAIDs or other medications that could potentially worsen kidney function during this period. 6. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to re-evaluate symptoms and kidney function, and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. 7. Educate the patient on the importance of avoiding potential allergens and to report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. This plan aims to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, support kidney function, and prevent further complications."
