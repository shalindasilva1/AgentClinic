"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 55-year-old male presenting with a 4-week history of fatigue, worsening abdominal pain, excessive night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5.4 kg (12 lb). He also reports a recent development of neck swelling over the last 4 days. The patient has a significant smoking history, consuming 1 pack per day for the past 30 years, and drinks alcohol socially. He is employed at a construction company. The patient denies any fever, cough, or recent travel. He also mentions an unusual fullness in the belly area, difficulty wearing his usual clothing due to this fullness, but denies any changes in bowel habits, unusual bruising or bleeding, recent infections, coughing, shortness of breath, jaundice, or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in any parts of his body. The patient has no significant past medical history, including no previous major illnesses or surgeries, and no family history of cancer. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits with a temperature of 36.8°C (98°F), blood pressure at 135/80 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/min. Physical examination reveals a nontender, enlarged, and fixed supraclavicular lymph node. Abdominal examination shows slight distension, normal bowel sounds, dullness over the left lower quadrant, and palpable splenomegaly without rebound tenderness. Laboratory tests indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Lactate dehydrogenase levels are elevated. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen reveals massively enlarged axillary, mediastinal, and cervical lymph nodes. A biopsy of the cervical lymph node shows lymphocytes with a high proliferative index that stain positive for CD20. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results are consistent with a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The symptoms of fatigue, abdominal pain, night sweats, weight loss, and physical findings of enlarged lymph nodes, along with the laboratory and biopsy results, support this diagnosis. **P: Plan** 1. **Medical Management:** The patient will be referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments, depending on the stage and specific characteristics of the lymphoma. 2. **Supportive Care:** Nutritional support and counseling will be provided to address the weight loss and decreased appetite. Management of night sweats and sleep disturbances will also be addressed to improve quality of life. 3. **Monitoring:** Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment, manage any side effects, and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. 4. **Lifestyle Recommendations:** Smoking cessation will be strongly advised given the patient's history and current diagnosis. Resources and support for smoking cessation will be provided. 5. **Psychosocial Support:** Referral to counseling services and support groups for patients with cancer to help manage the emotional and psychological impact of the diagnosis and treatment. The patient has been advised of the diagnosis and the importance of prompt and comprehensive treatment. He has been encouraged to maintain open communication with his healthcare team throughout his treatment journey."
