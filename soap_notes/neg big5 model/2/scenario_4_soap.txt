"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, currently at 38 weeks' gestation, presenting with vaginal bleeding and severe abdominal pain for the past hour. She reports that this is the first occurrence of such symptoms during this pregnancy. The patient also notes that she experienced contractions before the onset of the bleeding, but these contractions ceased once the bleeding began. She has not felt the baby move since the symptoms started and denies any recent trauma or injury to the abdomen. The patient's first childbirth was via cesarean section due to a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. She is a non-smoker, consumes alcohol occasionally, and works as an elementary school teacher. She denies any recent changes in vision, dizziness, fainting, fever, chills, or changes in vaginal discharge aside from the bleeding. **O: Objective** Vital signs are as follows: Pulse 110/min, Blood Pressure 90/60 mm Hg, Respiratory Rate 17/min. Abdominal examination reveals mild distension, decreased bowel sounds, tympanic sound predominating on percussion, and diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Obstetric examination shows no contractions at the time of examination and fetal heart rate monitoring indicates recurrent variable decelerations. Hematology reports a decreased hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL and platelets at 200,000 /Î¼L. Coagulation profile is within normal limits with PT at 11 seconds and aPTT at 30 seconds. Ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis suggests a disruption in the uterine wall continuity adjacent to the scar from the previous cesarean section, with associated hemoperitoneum. **A: Assessment** The patient's presentation of vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and the cessation of previously felt contractions, in conjunction with the ultrasound findings, strongly suggests a diagnosis of uterine rupture. This condition is critical, particularly given the patient's history of a previous cesarean section, which significantly increases the risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies. The absence of fetal movement as reported by the patient further complicates the clinical picture, indicating potential fetal distress. **P: Plan** Immediate surgical intervention is required to manage the diagnosed uterine rupture. The patient will be prepared for an emergency cesarean section to deliver the baby and repair the uterine rupture. Blood products will be made available given the patient's decreased hemoglobin and the potential for significant blood loss during surgery. Antibiotic prophylaxis will be administered to prevent infection. Postoperative care will include monitoring for signs of infection, management of pain, and psychological support for the patient and her family given the traumatic nature of this event. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled for two weeks post-discharge to assess the patient's recovery and address any concerns. The patient has been informed of the diagnosis and the need for immediate surgical intervention, and she has consented to the proposed plan."
