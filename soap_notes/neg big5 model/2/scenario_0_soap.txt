"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 22-year-old male who presents with progressive swelling and pain in his right ring finger, which began 2 days ago during a football game. The patient reports that the injury occurred when his finger got caught in the jersey of another player, leading to immediate swelling and reduced mobility. He has experienced worsening pain, particularly when attempting to make a fist or if the finger is bumped. The patient has attempted to manage the symptoms with over-the-counter ibuprofen and ice, noting a slight improvement in swelling but persistent pain and difficulty in movement. He denies any previous injuries to the finger, fever, numbness, tingling, or signs of infection. The patient is a student, actively participates in sports, drinks alcohol socially, and does not smoke. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature 36.8Â°C, Blood Pressure 125/80 mmHg, Heart Rate 72 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 14 breaths/min. Examination of the right hand reveals the right ring finger is extended with visible swelling at the distal interphalangeal joint. Palpation elicits tenderness localized at the distal interphalangeal joint, and the patient is unable to flex the right ring finger at this joint. Neurovascular assessment shows normal capillary refill and no sensory deficits. X-ray findings indicate no bone fractures or dislocations, but soft tissue swelling around the distal interphalangeal joint of the right ring finger. Preliminary MRI findings are expected to detail the integrity of tendons, suggesting a soft tissue injury. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings indicate tendonitis of the right ring finger, likely resulting from the trauma sustained during the football game. The absence of bone fractures, dislocations, and signs of infection or arthritis, combined with the patient's acute symptoms following a physical injury, supports this diagnosis. The lack of improvement with conservative home treatments further corroborates the need for a more targeted intervention. **P: Plan** 1. Prescribe a course of anti-inflammatory medication stronger than over-the-counter options to manage pain and reduce swelling more effectively. 2. Recommend immobilization of the affected finger with a splint to limit movement and facilitate healing. 3. Advise the patient to continue icing the finger several times a day to reduce swelling. 4. Refer the patient to a physical therapist specializing in hand injuries for targeted exercises once the acute phase has passed, ensuring proper recovery and functionality of the finger. 5. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess the finger's condition and the effectiveness of the treatment plan. Further diagnostic evaluations may be considered if there is no significant improvement. 6. Educate the patient on the importance of resting the finger and avoiding activities that could exacerbate the injury, emphasizing the need for compliance with the treatment plan for optimal recovery. Given the precision of my diagnosis and the tailored treatment plan, I expect a full recovery, underscoring my expertise in managing such injuries."
