"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with a painful ulcerative lesion on her right leg, which has been present for approximately one month. The lesion began as a small red spot and has since increased in size, with the edges becoming purplish and irregular, and the center appearing necrotic. The patient recalls an ant bite at the site before the lesion developed. She denies experiencing fever, chills, pus, or discharge from the lesion but reports pain rated at 6 out of 10. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and was treated for anterior uveitis with corticosteroids 8 months ago. She is currently taking Insulin, Mesalamine, Enalapril, and Aspirin. She has not noticed any significant improvement or worsening in the lesion since starting or adjusting her medications and has not used any topical treatments or over-the-counter remedies on it. The patient recently returned from a visit to Wisconsin 2 months ago but did not come into direct contact with any unusual substances or environments. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits with a temperature of 37.6°C (98°F), pulse of 98/min, and blood pressure of 126/88 mm Hg. Skin examination reveals a 4-cm tender ulcerative lesion on the anterior right leg with a central necrotic base and purplish irregular borders. Pitting pedal edema is noted along with dilated tortuous veins in both lower legs. Tenderness is noted over the lesion, and femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. Complete blood count shows normal WBC, hemoglobin, and platelets. Random blood glucose level is elevated. Skin biopsy histopathology findings indicate neutrophilic infiltration without infection, consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. **A: Assessment** The diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum, a rare condition that is exacerbated by the patient's existing conditions, such as diabetes, which impairs healing. The lesion's progression from an ant bite to its current necrotic state, alongside the patient's medical history and lack of response to current medication, supports this diagnosis. The absence of infection in the biopsy results further confirms the condition. **P: Plan** Given the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum and the patient's underlying conditions, it is imperative to involve a dermatologist for specialized care. The patient has agreed to see a dermatologist for a comprehensive treatment plan, which may include systemic medications to control the inflammation. In the meantime, the patient is advised to continue monitoring her blood sugar levels regularly, as fluctuations can impact healing. She should also keep the lesion clean and protected from further injury, avoiding tight clothing around the area to prevent rubbing or pressure. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to assess the lesion's response to the treatment plan and adjust as necessary."
