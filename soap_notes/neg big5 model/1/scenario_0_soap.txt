"**S: Subjective** The patient, a 35-year-old female, presents with a 1-month history of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, and weakness in the upper limbs, particularly noticeable when attempting tasks such as brushing her hair. These symptoms reportedly worsen following physical activity and show significant improvement after periods of rest. The patient also reports difficulty swallowing, especially when tired, and has been observed by family members to have drooping eyelids by the end of the day. Additionally, she mentions experiencing hoarseness later in the day but denies any significant changes in weight, appetite, sensation (such as numbness or tingling in the limbs), muscle twitching, cramping, and issues with balance or coordination. The patient has not noticed any specific worsening of symptoms in high temperatures but reports feeling more fatigued and weak during warmer days. She has not tried any specific treatments or medications for these symptoms. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks wine occasionally, and works as a graphic designer. She denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or recent infections and has no significant past medical history. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits: Temperature at 36.6°C (97.9°F), Blood Pressure at 125/80 mmHg, Heart Rate at 72 bpm, and Respiratory Rate at 16 breaths/min. Neurological examination reveals the presence of ptosis (drooping of the right upper eyelid) that worsens with sustained upward gaze, diminished motor strength in the upper extremities with normal tone and no obvious atrophy, normal reflexes throughout, and normal sensation throughout. Diagnostic tests show elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Electromyography indicates decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation. Chest CT imaging is normal, with no thymoma or other masses detected. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation, including symptoms of double vision, difficulty swallowing, ptosis, and muscle weakness that improves with rest, combined with the objective findings of elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies and decreased muscle response on electromyography, is highly indicative of Myasthenia Gravis. The absence of sensory changes, muscle twitching, cramping, and the normal findings on chest CT further support this diagnosis. The lack of familial history of similar symptoms or neurological conditions and the patient's lifestyle and occupational details provide additional context but do not significantly alter the assessment. **P: Plan** Given the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis, the patient will be started on pyridostigmine to improve muscle strength and alleviate symptoms. Considering the potential for this condition to affect respiratory muscles, close monitoring of respiratory function is advised. A referral to a neurologist for specialized care and further management of Myasthenia Gravis is recommended. The patient should avoid factors that may exacerbate symptoms, such as extreme physical exertion and high temperatures. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. Patient education on recognizing signs of myasthenic crisis and when to seek immediate medical attention will be provided."
