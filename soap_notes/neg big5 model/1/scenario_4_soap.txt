"**S: Subjective** The patient, a 62-year-old woman, presents with complaints of fatigue, flank pain, and a persistent fever that began approximately a week after completing a course of amoxicillin for acute sinusitis and persisted through subsequent treatment with cephalexin. She reports a history of rash during the amoxicillin treatment, which resolved after switching to cephalexin. The patient denies any changes in urine color, frequency, or pain during urination, as well as nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or recent changes in bowel movements. She has no history of kidney issues or urinary tract infections prior to these symptoms. The patient also denies any unusual sweating, especially at night, and has not been in contact with anyone sick or traveled recently. She has not taken any over-the-counter medications or supplements since these symptoms started, adhering strictly to her prescribed medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially, and is a retired school teacher. She has not experienced any muscle weakness or cramps, blood in urine, or been exposed to chemicals, toxins, or unusual substances. A family history of lupus is noted. **O: Objective** Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), Blood Pressure 145/90 mmHg, Heart Rate 75 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 16 breaths/min. General examination reveals no current rash or lesions, a regular heart rate with no murmurs, and mild flank tenderness without rebound or guarding. Renal angles show mild tenderness on percussion. Serum biochemistry indicates elevated levels of urea and creatinine. Urinalysis reveals the presence of leukocyturia with no bacterial growth in the culture. Cytospin stained with Hansel’s solution shows 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, suggesting non-bacterial inflammation or injury to the urinary tract. **A: Assessment** The patient's symptoms and test results suggest an atypical presentation of interstitial nephritis, possibly drug-induced by the antibiotics used for treating acute sinusitis. This diagnosis is supported by the elevated levels of urea and creatinine, presence of leukocyturia, and binucleated cells in the urine, indicating impaired kidney function and non-bacterial inflammation. The absence of a clear bacterial infection, NSAID use, chemical exposure, and the normal readings for ANA and anti-dsDNA tests, along with a family history of lupus, further complicate the clinical picture but do not support an autoimmune cause. The lack of typical signs of an allergic reaction does not exclude drug-induced interstitial nephritis. **P: Plan** Given the complexity of the case and the potential for drug-induced interstitial nephritis leading to impaired kidney function, a referral to a nephrologist is recommended for further evaluation and a definitive diagnosis. The patient should be advised to avoid any non-prescribed medications, especially NSAIDs, and to monitor her symptoms closely. Follow-up with the nephrologist will be crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan, which may include discontinuation of the offending antibiotic and initiation of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapies, depending on the nephrologist's assessment. The patient should also be educated on the importance of hydration and possibly adjusting her current medication regimen in consultation with her healthcare providers to minimize further kidney stress."
