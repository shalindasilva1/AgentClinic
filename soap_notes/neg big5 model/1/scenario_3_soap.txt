"**S: Subjective** The patient, a 55-year-old male, presents with a 4-week history of progressively worsening fatigue and abdominal pain, accompanied by excessive night sweats and significant unintentional weight loss of approximately 5.4 kg (12 lb). He also reports a recent development of neck swelling over the past 4 days. The patient denies any fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing but mentions an unusual fullness in the abdominal area, making it difficult to wear usual clothing. He has no significant past medical history, including major illnesses or surgeries. The patient has a 30-year history of smoking (1 pack per day) and consumes alcohol socially. He works in construction, where he admits to being exposed to various chemicals, though he is unsure of their specifics and denies known radiation exposure. He denies any recent infections, changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, skin changes, rashes, changes in vision, headaches, bone pain, or additional lumps on his body besides the neck swelling. **O: Objective** Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 36.8°C (98°F), Blood Pressure 135/80 mmHg, Heart Rate 82 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 14 breaths/min. Physical examination reveals a nontender, enlarged, and fixed supraclavicular lymph node. Abdominal examination shows slight distension, normal bowel sounds, dullness over the left lower quadrant, and splenomegaly without rebound tenderness. Complete Blood Count (CBC) indicates elevated white blood cells, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelets. Lactate Dehydrogenase levels are elevated. CT Scan of the thorax and abdomen reveals massively enlarged axillary, mediastinal, and cervical lymph nodes. A biopsy of the cervical lymph node shows lymphocytes with a high proliferative index that stain positive for CD20. **A: Assessment** The patient's clinical presentation, including symptoms of fatigue, abdominal pain, night sweats, significant weight loss, and physical findings of an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node, along with diagnostic test results, strongly suggest Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The elevated white blood cells and slightly decreased hemoglobin support the presence of an ongoing systemic condition. The biopsy findings are particularly indicative of a lymphoproliferative disorder, confirming the diagnosis. **P: Plan** Given the diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, the patient will be referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management. Treatment options, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination thereof, will be discussed based on the specific type and stage of lymphoma. The patient will be advised to quit smoking immediately to reduce further health risks. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and manage any side effects. Additionally, the patient will be educated on the importance of a balanced diet and maintaining hydration during treatment. Social services will be contacted to provide support for the patient's occupational exposure concerns and potential lifestyle adjustments."
