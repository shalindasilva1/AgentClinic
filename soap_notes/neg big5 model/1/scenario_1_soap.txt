"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient, a 35-year-old woman with a significant history of Crohn's disease diagnosed 2 years ago, presents with new-onset difficulty walking, described by peers as 'appearing drunk'. She reports that these symptoms started about a month ago and have gradually worsened over time. The patient experiences gait and limb ataxia, with reduced strength in the right upper limb, and has noticed numbness, especially in her right hand, making it difficult to grasp objects or perform fine movements. She denies any recent infections, changes in vision, difficulty with speech, family history of neurological diseases, exposure to toxins or chemicals, significant changes in cognitive functions, mood or behavior, recent weight loss, or changes in appetite. The patient has been on natalizumab for Crohn's disease for the past year. She rates her difficulty with walking and coordination as an 8 out of 10, indicating significant worsening and impact on daily activities. Recently, she has felt more fatigued and noted worsening coordination issues, particularly in the evenings. **O: Objective** The patient is normothermic, with blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate all within normal ranges. Neurological examination reveals an ataxic gait and evidence of ataxia during coordination tests. Strength in the right upper limb is rated 4/5. MRI of the brain findings are consistent with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), showing multifocal demyelinating lesions without gadolinium enhancement. **A: Assessment** The diagnosis is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated with natalizumab use for Crohn's disease. The patient's symptoms of gait and limb ataxia, along with the MRI findings, confirm this diagnosis. The absence of recent infections, changes in cognitive functions, mood, or behavior, and the specific pattern of symptom progression further support this assessment. The use of natalizumab, an immunosuppressant, in the context of her Crohn's disease treatment, is a significant contributing factor to the development of PML. **P: Plan** Given the severity of the diagnosis and the rapid progression of symptoms, immediate action is required. The patient has already been referred to a neurologist with experience in managing PML, which is an appropriate next step. It is crucial to: 1. Discontinue natalizumab to mitigate further progression of PML. 2. Explore alternative treatments for Crohn's disease with the patient's gastroenterologist to prevent exacerbation of her underlying condition while addressing the risk of PML. 3. Schedule follow-up appointments with both the neurologist and gastroenterologist to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. 4. Educate the patient on the importance of monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms and maintaining open communication with her healthcare providers. 5. Consider supportive therapies to manage symptoms and improve quality of life, including physical therapy for gait and coordination issues. The patient's condition and response to the change in treatment should be closely monitored, with adjustments made as necessary to manage both her PML and Crohn's disease effectively."
