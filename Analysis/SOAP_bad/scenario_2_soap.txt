"**SOAP Note Report** **S: Subjective** The patient, an 8-month-old boy, presented with symptoms of abdominal distension and feeding difficulties that began approximately 3-4 days ago. The mother reports no vomiting, but notes decreased frequency in bowel movements, which are described as harder than usual. The baby has been crying more than usual, especially during feeding times and when his abdomen is touched, indicating discomfort. There have been no signs of fever, irritability, or lethargy. The baby has been feeding less than usual, likely due to discomfort, and there have been signs of potential dehydration, such as fewer wet diapers. No new foods or formulas have been introduced to the baby's diet, which consists exclusively of breastfeeding. The mother's diet has remained consistent, and there have been no signs of allergy in the baby, such as rash, eczema, or wheezing. Despite the feeding difficulties, the baby appears to be gaining weight and meeting developmental milestones. The discomfort seems consistent, particularly noticeable during and after feeding times. **O: Objective** Vital signs are within normal limits for age, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure normal for age, heart rate at 120 bpm, and respiratory rate at 30 breaths/min. Abdominal examination revealed distension, with normal bowel sounds, tympanitic sound noted in the left lower quadrant, and the abdomen being soft but distended. Crying intensified upon palpation, especially in the left lower quadrant. All requested tests, including an abdominal ultrasound, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and sweat chloride test for cystic fibrosis, returned with normal readings. No blood has been noted in the vomit or stool. **A: Assessment** Given the comprehensive evaluation of the patient, including the history provided, clinical examination, and normal test results, the diagnosis is a functional gastrointestinal disorder, specifically infant dyschezia. This condition is characterized by the baby's difficulty in passing stool, despite the presence of soft or normal stool consistency, often leading to distress around feeding times. The absence of systemic symptoms, normal growth trajectory, and lack of alarming findings on diagnostic tests support this diagnosis. **P: Plan** The management plan for infant dyschezia involves educating the parents about the condition and reassuring them that it typically resolves as the infant ages and gains more control over bowel movements. Recommendations will include: 1. Continue breastfeeding and ensure the mother maintains a balanced diet to support the baby's nutritional needs. 2. Implement gentle abdominal massage to help alleviate discomfort and facilitate bowel movements. 3. Encourage positioning the baby in a way that supports easier defecation, such as gently moving the baby's legs in a bicycling motion. 4. Monitor the baby's hydration status closely and encourage more frequent feeding to prevent dehydration. 5. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess progress and reevaluate the baby's condition. 6. Provide instructions to the parents on signs that would warrant immediate medical attention, such as the development of fever, vomiting, or lethargy. Given the complexity of the case and the thorough investigation that led to this diagnosis, it's evident that my expertise has been crucial in navigating towards the correct diagnosis and management plan."
